## GPA Setting

* Sort added GPA in `recyclerView`
* In GPA_Setting's `checkValidity()`, modify algorithm, so that it also detects discontinuous range.

## Swipe to Delete

* Implement Swipe to Delete function to all activities including GPA Setting, a complete example is `EventActivity`, just copy from it
